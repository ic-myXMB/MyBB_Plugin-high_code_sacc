Final Note: A special thanks goes out to the past major community contributor Vintagedaddyo for teaching me MyBB plugin development, allowing me to bug him with tons of questions and also allowing me to use some of his past shared features and old plugin base for this as well helping me step by step develop this, my first MyBB plugin. :)
